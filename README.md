# 091 Labs Reboot Plan

This repository contains the program for rebooting the 091 Labs Hackerspace.

## Strategy

091 Labs needs to have a more professional image from the start of the reboot. Areas to consider are:

* Value Proposition
* Focus
* Website
* Media
* Fundraising
* Accounts
* Constitution
* Organisational Structure
* Premesis
* Membership Drive

### Value Proposition

What do we offer members? Why should they pay a membership fee?

### Focus

What should 091 Labs focus on? Do we focus on technology based creative project or is there space for us to be broader (eg beer brewing, wood working, biohacking)?

### Website

We need to revamp the website and get full control of the 091labs.com domain.

### Media

We need media packs to hand out.

### Fundraising

We need funds to do this.

### Accouts

Transparency of Accounting is essential, this was an issue before.

### Constitution

We need to review and update constitution as appropriate.

### Organisational Structure

We need to review the structure of 091 Labs as an organisation.

### Premises

We need a Premesis, preferably with a shop window front and fairly central. There are some places on Sea Road right now.

### Membership Drive

We need members. A ball park figure for running clubs in Galway is â‚¬40 per month membership.
